      Hi there, I'm John! I just graduated Georgia Tech's Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. After 11 years working as a personal and executive assistant, I'm ready for a new long term career. I hope it can be with your company! Communication, professionalism, and the ability to use Google are just a few skills I bring. In my freetime, I play D&D twice a week, write music, and volunteer for a wide variety of LGBTQ+ causes.
